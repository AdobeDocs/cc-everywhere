# Documentation Linting Process

This rule defines the process for running and fixing linting issues in documentation files.

## Process Steps

1. Run the linter:
   ```sh
   yarn lint
   ```

2. Review the output for markdown linting errors. Common issues include:
   - MD047/single-trailing-newline: Missing newline at end of file
   - MD009/no-trailing-spaces: Trailing spaces in lines
   - MD013/line-length: Lines exceeding maximum length
   - MD041/first-line-heading: Missing heading at start of file
   - MD022/headings: Headings not following sentence case

3. Fix identified issues:
   - For missing newlines: Add a newline at the end of the file using:
     ```sh
     echo "" >> <file_path>
     ```
   - For trailing spaces: Remove trailing spaces using:
     ```sh
     sed -i '' 's/ $//' <file_path>
     ```
   - For heading case issues: Ensure headings follow sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)
   - For line length issues: Break long lines at appropriate points
   - For missing headings: Add appropriate heading at start of file

4. Verify fixes:
   ```sh
   yarn lint
   ```

## Common Fixes

### Adding Missing Newlines
When a file is missing a newline at the end (MD047), use:
```sh
echo "" >> <file_path>
```

### Removing Trailing Spaces
When a file has trailing spaces (MD009), use:
```sh
sed -i '' 's/ $//' <file_path>
```

### Fixing Multiple Issues
To fix both trailing spaces and add a newline:
```sh
sed -i '' 's/ $//' <file_path> && echo "" >> <file_path>
```

## Notes

- The linter may show warnings in YAML files about missing document start markers (`---`) and line length. These are not critical errors.
- Some files may have platform-specific warnings (e.g., platform mismatch) which can be safely ignored.
- The linter exits with code 0 when `DISABLE_ERRORS` is set to true, even if there are warnings.
- Always verify fixes by running the linter again after making changes.

## Checklist

- [ ] Run `yarn lint`
- [ ] Review and document all linting errors
- [ ] Fix each identified issue
- [ ] Run `yarn lint` again to verify fixes
- [ ] Document any remaining warnings that are acceptable to ignore
