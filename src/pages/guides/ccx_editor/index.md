Using the CCX Editor, developers can give end users an easy way to start a creative design workflow from within their own applications.

The CCX Editor component can be embedded in your web application today, by following these guides: 
* [Create a new CCX project](create_project/index.md)
* [Edit existing CCX project](edit_project/index.md)
