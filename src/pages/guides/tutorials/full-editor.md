# Embed SDK Full Editor tutorial

A step-by-step guide to setting up and integrating the Embed SDK into your web application.

**TODO**: add a video, Davide-style.

## Introduction

Hi, developers! In this tutorial, we'll create an Embed SDK integration that leverages the Adobe Express Full Editor experience. Users will be able to create, edit and export documents directly from your web application. We'll look at a few configuration parameters, as well as the way to handle events, callbacks and manage files between your application and Adobe Express. Let's get started!

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- An Adobe account: use your existing Adobe ID or create one for free.
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Node.js installed on your development machine.
