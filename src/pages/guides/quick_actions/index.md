IMPORTANT: Deprecation Warning

This version of the docs and SDK will be sunsetted later this year. As a result, we are no longer approving new submissions that integrate with v2.

Instead, we would love for you to start integrating the new version of the SDK. To join the private beta and get early access to documentation, please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shryiOk1VwoWxUCZs?prefill_Platform=Adobe%20Express%20Embed%20SDK&hide_Platform=true).

# Quick actions

Quick actions give you access to image and video editing tools powered by Adobe Photoshop and Premiere.

## What are quick actions?

Adobe-powered quick actions take the most complex tasks from our flagship apps -- like remove background -- and turns them into one-click tasks. The quick actions component is embedded onto your application as an iframe.

Once the desired action is complete, the SDK provides two native export buttons to surface to users: 1) download the modified asset or 2) edit further in the full editor component. You can also configure your own custom export button to perform tasks such as saving the asset back into the application.

## Get started

The quick actions component can be embedded in your web application today, by following these guides:

* [Embedding image quick actions](image/index.md)
* [Embedding video quick actions](video/index.md)
