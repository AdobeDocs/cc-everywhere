# Edit Image v2

Welcome to the new and improved Edit Image v2 experience in the Adobe Express Embed SDK!

## Features overview

The new Edit Image experience has been rearchitected to deliver significantly improved performance and a better user experience. This update has **reduced load times by 35â€“50%** and **memory consumption by 35%**.

The UI has been redesigned to provide a more user-friendly experience, with a closer implementation of the new Adobe Spectrum 2 design system among other improvements.

A tabbed interface separates the editing tools (**Crop**, **Remove Background**, **Erase**, **Remove Object**, **Insert Object**) and the other features (**Adjust**, **Corners**, **Flip**, **Opacity**) from the Effects section.
