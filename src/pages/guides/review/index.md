# Submission and review

Adobe reviews all applications that integrate Adobe Express Embed SDK before enabling it for public use.

## Overview

This guideline outlines the process for submitting an integration using the Adobe Express Embed SDK for review.
Whether you’re embedding the Full Editor, Quick Actions, or Modules, adhering to these guidelines will ensure a seamless experience for your users and maintain consistency across all implementations.

<InlineAlert variant="help" slots="text" />

Please note that until your integration is approved, it will display a red banner indicating, the experience powred by Adobe Express has not been approved yet. Once we review and approve your app, we will remove this banner.

This process is valuable, as gaining approval enhances the credibility of your integration and fosters trust among your users.

<InlineAlert slots="text" />

We aim to review your integration within 10 business days of submission, and will let you know if it is accepted, rejected, or if any changes need to be made.

## Our review criteria

Our reviewers will assess your submission based on a variety of factors, including:

- Branding
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Harmful or unacceptable content
- User Experience
- Transparency
- Presence of bugs or harmful code

## Pre-Submission checklist

### Correct namespace usage

Verify that you're using the appropriate namespace (Full Editor, Quick Actions, or Modules) based on your integration’s functionality.

### Appropriate brand usage

Read our brand guidelines. Before you submit your integration for review, please read our [brand guidelines](../../assets/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf). To adhere to our brand requirements, you can [download the assets here](https://developer.adobe.com/distribute/cc-brand-assets).

### Inappropriate content

Any application embedding an Adobe product is a reflection on Adobe and our developer community and is accessible by all users. We encourage you to use your best judgment when submitting content for review and to ensure that your submitted content is reflective of your brand.

- **No adult content.**
No integrations may contain intense violence, blood, gore, sexual content, nudity or strong language.
- **No malicious content of any kind.**
Integrations may not contain or promote (for example) phishing, spamming, hacking, password trafficking, spyware, or contain malware, trojans, or viruses.
- **No illegal or questionable content.**
Integrations may not contain or promote illegal or highly-regulated activities. For example, pharmaceutical sales, promotions or sweepstakes, alcohol or tobacco sales. Integrations may not violate intellectual property rights. For example, applications may not promote DRM circumvention, or contain copyrighted or trademarked content belonging to someone else. Integrations may not promote hatred, violence, or bullying. For example, applications may not contain hate speech, or promote or enable cruel behavior towards others.

### Legal

By creating a project using the SDK in Adobe Developer Console, you are agreeing to the Adobe Developer Terms of Use. Adobe reserves the right to disable your integration if your app does not adhere to the terms.

Additionally, your integration must not violate the trademarks and copyrights of Adobe, Inc., or those of any other party. Please adhere to all trademark guidelines as noted [here](https://www.adobe.com/legal/permissions/trademarks.html).
