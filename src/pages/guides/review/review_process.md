# Overview

Congratulations! You're on your way to getting your integration into the hands of your users.

## Our review process

Our teams are working on new submissions every day. Depending on volume, it can be up to 10 business days before you hear a response from us. On average, we approve integrations within 3 business days.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at [ccintrev@adobe.com](mailto:ccintrev@adobe.com) or reach out on our [Adobe Express Embed SDK community forum](https://community.adobe.com/t5/express-embed-sdk/ct-p/ct-express-embed-sdk?page=1&sort=latest_replies&lang=all&tabid=all).

## Submit for review

Once you think you're good to go, click the **Submit for Review** button in the [Developer console](https://developer.adobe.com/console).

### Initial review

Adobeâ€™s team will perform an initial review, focusing on technical correctness, design, and user experience. This process may take up to 10 business days.

### Feedback and revisions

If any changes or improvements are required, you will receive feedback with detailed instructions. You can resubmit after addressing the feedback.

### Approval

Once your integration passes all stages of review, you will receive an approval notification, and your integration will be published or distributed as required.
If it was rejected, we will include the reasons for rejection along with any next steps. If you'd like to back and edit your submission, you can do so in the Developer Console. Checkout how to [handle rejections](./rejections.md) here.
