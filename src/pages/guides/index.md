# Overview

Adobe Express Embed SDK is an easy-to-integrate, customizable, all-in-one JavaScript library that brings Adobe Express capabilities to web applications.

## Adobe Express Embed SDK

Adobe Express Embed SDK lets you embed Adobe Express editing capabilities on your own website. This documentation provides all the materials you need to get started with the SDK. Try them now in our [demo app](https://demo.expressembed.com/).

### What is the full editor?

[Adobe Express](https://adobe.com/express) makes it easy to create with thousands of beautiful templates, plus assets for social media content, logos, and more. Even without any design experience, Adobe Express users can create standout content from wherever they work. The SDK lets you embed the full Adobe Express editor on your own website. Users can create within the editor as they would in Adobe Express, with access to thousands of templates and powerful features like text-to-image. Any projects can be saved to your application for other tasks.

### What are quick actions?

[Quick actions](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/quick-actions) are fast editing tools for images and videos. This SDK lets you embed quick actions on your own website with just a few lines of code. You can configure what export options are surfaced to your users once they are done with editing tasks (i.e. download, save back to app, edit in an embedded Adobe Express editor).

### What are modules?

[Modules](../guides/modules/index.md) are contained mini-editing experiences that you can surface to your users. The modules available at this time are **Text to Image** and **Edit Image**.
