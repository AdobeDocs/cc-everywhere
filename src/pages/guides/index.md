### How do users experience the CCX Editor and Quick Actions?  
__CCX Editor__:
* When the CCX editor is first started up: a CCX iframe will appear in a modal and the user will be asked to either log in, or create a CCX account.
* Once logged in, users can access CCX's huge template and asset library and start creating in a new blank project. They can save the project in CCX once finished. 
* The CCX Editor can also be spun up taking a CCX project ID as input, and users can continue working on an existing CCX project within the editor.

__Quick Actions Editor__:
* Users must select the desired Quick Action (QA) so the corresponding QA editor is spun up. Within the QA Editor, users can browse their filesystem for an asset, and then perform the selected QA. They can download the modified asset to their computer, or further customize the modified asset in a CCX editor.
