# Adobe Express Embed SDK documentation

Embed Powerful Creative Tools Directly into Your Website

## Overview

The Adobe Express Embed SDK equips your platform with robust design, photo editing, video editing, and AI-powered tools, offering your users a seamless creative experience without leaving your site.

Try them now in our [demo app](https://demo.expressembed.com/).

### What is the full editor?

[Adobe Express](https://adobe.com/express) makes it easy to create with thousands of beautiful templates, plus assets for social media content, logos, and more. Even without any design experience, Adobe Express users can create standout content from wherever they work. The SDK lets you embed the full Adobe Express editor on your own website. Users can create within the editor as they would in Adobe Express, with access to thousands of templates and powerful features like text-to-image. Any projects can be saved to your application for other tasks.

### What are quick actions?

[Quick actions](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/quick-actions) are fast editing tools for images and videos. This SDK lets you embed quick actions on your own website with just a few lines of code. You can configure what export options are surfaced to your users once they are done with editing tasks (i.e. download, save back to app, edit in an embedded Adobe Express editor).

### What are modules?

[Modules](../guides/modules/index.md) are contained mini-editing experiences that you can surface to your users. The modules available at this time are **Generate Image** and **Edit Image**.
