# Full editor

Using the full editor, developers can give end-users an easy way to start a creative design workflow from within their own applications.

## What is the full editor?

The full editor component allows you to embed Adobe Express as an iframe in their own applications. Users can work within this modal editor as they would in Adobe Express, and their designs can be saved back to the integrating application as images. Each project created using the full editor is automatically saved into the user's Adobe Express account.

## Get started

Users can access Adobe Express's huge template and asset library when starting with a blank new project in the editor. The editor component allows you to pass a starting image asset to be pre-loaded. The editor can also load previous projects (created using your integration) by taking an existing project ID as input.
