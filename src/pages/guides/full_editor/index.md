# Full editor

Using the full editor, developers can give end-users an easy way to start a creative design workflow from within their own applications. Try it out for yourself in our [demo app](https://demo.expressembed.com).

## What is the full editor?

The SDK allows you to embed the full Adobe Express editor as an iframe in your own application. Users can work within this modal editor as they would in Adobe Express, and their designs can be saved back to the integrating application as images. Each project created using the full editor is automatically saved into the user's Adobe Express account.

## Read our guides

Users can access Adobe Express's huge template and asset library when starting to create in the editor. You can also launch the editor with a starting asset passed from your application. The editor can also load previous projects (created using your integration) by taking an existing project ID as input.

* [Launch an embedded editor in your application](create_project\index.md)
* [Load a previous project in the editor](edit_project\index.md)
