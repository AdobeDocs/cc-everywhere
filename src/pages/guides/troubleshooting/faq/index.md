## Answers

### Do you have a mobile SDK?

Our efforts are currently focused on desktop apps and web.

### Do my users need to have an Adobe ID?

Users will need to sign in using an existing Adobe ID, or create an account, in order to save projects created. Projects will be saved to the user’s Adobe Express account in a folder named after your integration.

Creating an account for Adobe Express is always free with premium upgrades available.

### Is there a cost to use the SDK?

While there is currently no cost to access the Adobe Express Embed SDK, this may change over time. We look forward to working with our partners and developer community to better understand your users’ needs as we continue to evolve our strategy.

### How does the full editor provided by the SDK differ from the free/paid versions of Adobe Express on the web?

There are two functional differences in the embedded Adobe Express full editor compared to Adobe Express on the web:

- Content sharing: In an embedded experience, we assume that a user will save the outcome of their creative project back to the host application in order to continue work in the host application. We have disabled sharing capabilities in embedded Adobe Express experiences.
- Content publishing: For the same reason above, you have the ability to pre-define the output type (file types, pixel size, etc.) of the Adobe Express project that is saved to the host application. For this reason, post scheduling and exporting multiple output types are disabled for the embedded Adobe Express editor.

### My user base consists of students/minors. How can I be assured they get appropriate content?

The embedded Adobe Express full editor can be setup to launch student safe content even before a student is signed into the embedded experience. More information about [Adobe & Student Privacy](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/student-policy.html).

### How many domains can be added with a single API key for a service?

You can add upto five domains with a single API key. Additionally, there is no limit on the number of subdomains that you can employ for these services. Use wildcards to enter [multiple subdomains](../express-unavailable-error.md#wrong-domain-or-port) (`*.my-domain.com`) or commas to separate multiple domains (`www.domain-1.com`, `www.domain-2.com`). During local development, you can include ports greater than `1023` with localhost (example, `localhost:3000`). Standard ports (`80`, `443`) will be used for non-localhost domains.

### How do I enable SSO for my service?

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for your service, when using Adobe express Embed SDK, you need to set it up using the Adobe admin console.

Learn to use the Adobe Admin Console to set up [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/enterprise/using/sso-overview.html) with your Identity provider and troubleshoot setup-related problems.

### Would Adobe need to approve the integrations before my users can start using it?

Your users can use the integrations, but, we will display a red banner indicating, `The experience powered by Adobe Express has not been approved yet`. Once we review and approve your app, we will remove this banner.

### What is the versioning strategy for the SDK?

- The SDK follows a continous release model, with newer versions including bug fixes and feature enhancements. We are no longer approving integrations using using SDK V1, V2, or V3.
- V1 and V2 are deprecated and V3 will be deprecated in 2024.
- Please migrate to V4 as soon as possible: we've created a [Migration Guide](../../concepts/migration_v3_v4.md) to help you with the transition.

### Which web browsers are supported?

- Google Chrome: Version 100 or later
- Microsoft Edge: Version 107 or later
- Safari: Version 17 or later
- Firefox: Version 117 or later

You can refer to the complete [technical requirements](../../quickstart/technical-requirements.md) here.

### What operating systems are supported?

- Windows: Version 10 or later
- macOS: Version 11 or later
- ChromeOS

You can refer to the complete [technical requirements](../../quickstart/technical-requirements.md) here.

### I run into the "Adobe Express is not available" error

Please refer to this [troubleshooting guide](../express-unavailable-error.md).

### How can I debug and troubleshoot errors effectively?

Refer to the [error handling guide](../../concepts/error-handling.md) provided with the SDK documentation. It includes detailed information on understanding exceptions, accessing error metadata, and best practices for handling different types of errors.
