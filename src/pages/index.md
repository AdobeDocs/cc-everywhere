## Overview

This documentation provides all the materials you need to start integrating Adobe Express components into your own applications. Designed to support web (and in the future, mobile) platforms, over time it will include live template generation and other modular building blocks for content-first, task-based creative tooling drawn from Adobe Express. As of today, this SDK has two components: the __full editor__ and __quick actions__.

### What is the full editor?

[Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/) makes it easy to get started with thousands of beautiful templates, plus assets for social media content, logos, and more. Even without any design experience, Adobe Express users can create standout content from wherever they work.

The full editor component is embedded onto your application as an iframe. Users can work within this modal editor as they would in Adobe Express, and their designs can be saved back to the integrating application as images.

### What are quick actions?

[Quick actions](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/quick-actions) are fast editing tools for images and videos, powered by Photoshop and Premiere. Developers can embed the quick actions component in their own applications to give end users access to these tools.

The quick actions component is embedded onto your application as an iframe. Users can work within this modal editor and once the action is completed, the modified asset can be downloaded or saved back to the integrating application.
