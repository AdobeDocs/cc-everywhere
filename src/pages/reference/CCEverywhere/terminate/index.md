# terminate()

<InlineAlert variant="error" slots="header, text1, text2" />

IMPORTANT: Deprecation Warning

We are no longer approving integrations using v1 or v2 of the SDK - both versions will be deprecated later this year.

While we are in beta, all v3 clients are disabled by default. **Please share your API key with amandah@adobe.com to begin development.**

## terminate: () => void

The default method `terminate()` will un-initialize the `CCEverywhere` object. This method returns `void`.
