IMPORTANT: Deprecation Warning

This version of the docs and SDK will be sunsetted later this year. As a result, we are no longer approving new submissions that integrate with v2.

Instead, we would love for you to start integrating the new version of the SDK. To join the private beta and get early access to documentation, please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shryiOk1VwoWxUCZs?prefill_Platform=Adobe%20Express%20Embed%20SDK&hide_Platform=true).
